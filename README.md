# Fallout Hacking Game

**Idea from the following link: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3qjnil/20151028_challenge_238_intermediate_fallout/**

Simple Java game based off the Fallout computer hacking minigame in where the player is presented with a list of words with 4 changes to guess the correct word. Each guess will return how many letters from that word are contained in the correct word. See the sample playthough in the screenshot below:
