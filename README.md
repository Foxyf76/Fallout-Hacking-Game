# Fallout Hacking Game

**Idea from the following link: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3qjnil/20151028_challenge_238_intermediate_fallout/**

Simple Java game based off the Fallout computer hacking minigame in which the player is presented with a list of words with 4 chances to guess the correct word. Each guess will return how many letters from that word are contained in the correct word. The difficulty can be chosen to increase word length/count. See the sample playthough in the screenshot below:
